PassGen Disclaimers: A Buffet of Whimsy
Strong Passwords: Buckle up, buttercup! These passwords are tougher than a naan in a sandstorm. They'll lock your data tighter than a rickshaw driver during rush hour. But remember, great power comes great responsibility (and potential keyboard meltdowns). Use them wisely, like that last samosa at the iftar table.

Weak Passwords: Tread lightly, grasshopper. These passwords are about as secure as a jalebi in a rainstorm. They might get you by for basic browsing, but don't expect them to withstand a serious cyber attack. Think of them as training wheels for your password journey. Just don't get too attached, you'll graduate to stronger stuff soon enough.

Funny Passwords: Get ready to giggle, snort, and maybe even do a little jig. These passwords are like the uncle at the wedding telling cheesy jokes – pure entertainment, zero practicality. Use them for fun accounts, like your grandma's Facebook profile or your secret stash of cat videos. Just remember, laughter is the best medicine, not the best security.

General Disclaimer: PassGen is like a magic genie for passwords, but we can't grant eternal wishes (or foolproof cybersecurity). Use these passwords at your own risk, and remember, the ultimate responsibility for your online safety lies with you. So, browse responsibly, password like a pro, and maybe throw in a few cheeky jabs with our funny options. Just don't blame us if your nosy neighbor suddenly knows all your online secrets.

Bonus Disclaimer: We're not responsible for any sudden urges to sing Bollywood hits or develop an insatiable craving for biryani after using PassGen. It's just a side effect of pure, unadulterated Pakistani awesomeness. You've been warned!
